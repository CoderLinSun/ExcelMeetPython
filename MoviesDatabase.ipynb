    "# Conclusion\n",
    "It was a nice experience to realize how much I was able to achieve with actually very little programming experience. I was very satisified as I finally saw my statsistics displayed. Funny to see that the earnings of \"Gone with the Wind\", when taking inflation into account, was at least as profitable as today's movies (with much less spectators).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this programming experience was interesting, it also became clear to me that I would need much more effort to be able to master it. I actually spent more time looking for solution on Google than actually programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, performing this kind of tasks need a much broader programming experience, notabely in Python. My actual knowledge is by far not sufficient for an efficient work. I still miss a lot of basic knowledge (tuples, dictionaries, classes, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second there is a problem inherant to Python itself. Many libraries are available to help you achieve your goals, and this is a very nice think. But often more than just one library is available for a given functionality. Which one shall I chose? I must be an \"expert\" in different alternative libraries to be able to evaluate. For instance I chose to use *matplotlib* for drawing. But I later saw some comments criticizing it, saying the graphic quality is not so good. So what do you do in that case? Shall you rewrite all your code. Or if you notice after a while, that the library you have chosen does not offer the functionality you happen to need after three months coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that this project, where I could comment my approach 'live', may be interesting and motivating for other students who wants to go deeper. I think I could show the problems that begginers encounter when they start such a \"big\" project. I hope my work can be useful to other beginners. I would never have been able to do it without the support of some more exprienced programmers.\n"
