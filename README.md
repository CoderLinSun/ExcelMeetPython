# Excel meets Python

My goal in this project is to explore the possibilities offered by Python in combination with Excel.\
As a Python beginner I knew it would not be wise to start a too complex project. So I intentionally limited the scope of my project to the most simple and usual Excel functions. I found a film database containing data of films from nearly the beginning of the film industry until now and I use it to practice my skills.

I decided to use Junyper as framework underlying the presentation of my project as proposed by some other Python students. It was a good decision. It allows me to combine code and explanations/instructions on a single platform and make everything very clear.

The following packages have to be installed:
```
  pip install --upgrade pip

  pip install jupyter
  pip install pandas
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install xlrd
  pip install xlwt
```

To run my Juypter project proceed as follows:

1. Create a directory <DIR\>
1. Open a command shell
1. Go to that directory <DIR\>
1. Copy *movies.xls*, *inflation_data.xlsx*, *MovieDatabase.ipynb* and *pandas-data-structure.svg* to that directory <DIR\>
1. ``jupyter notebook`` \
The browser should be started automatically and Juypter environment started.
1. Double click on *MovieDatabase.ipynb*
1. Run the project step by step
